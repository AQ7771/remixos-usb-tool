     * The implementations of W3C XML Schema's(WXS) number types, more specifically
     * their value spaces, must in the end be represented by primitive C++ types.
     * In addition, there is an extensive range of functions and classes that in
     * different ways deals with data that will end up as instances of the WXS
     * types. For this reason, a set of typedefs for these primitives exists, that
     * are used throughout the API. This ensures consistency, reduces the amount
     * of conversions, and potentially precision loss in conversions.
