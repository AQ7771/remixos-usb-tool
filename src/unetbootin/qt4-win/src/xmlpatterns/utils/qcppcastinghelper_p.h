    /**
     * @short Provides convenience methods for performing static casts between C++ classes.
     *
     * In Patternist, it is very common to do up-casts from Expression or Item, which typically
     * involves writing messy code. Such an old-way cast looks like this:
     *
     * @code
     * static_cast<const MyClass *>(myInstance.data())->myClassMember()
     * @endcode
     *
     * CppCastingHelper provides the convenience method as() for this, which is functionally
     * equivalent to the above code, but simpler:
     *
     * @code
     * myInstance->as<MyClass>()->myClassMember()
     * @endcode
     *
     * The as() function performs a static cast.
     *
     * By using CppCastingHelper, this is achieved:
     *
     * - Const correctness is automatically taken care of
     * - Less code to write
     * - When compiling in debug mode, the as() functions uses a @c dynamic_cast to verify that the
     *   static casts are properly done, such that sensible error messages are given when the casts
     *   are invalid. It also traps invalid casts which nevertheless happen to work on a particular
     *   platform/compiler/hardware architecture.
     *
     * CppCastingHelper is a template class where the TSubClass parameter must be the class
     * inheriting CppCastingHelper. See Item or Expression for demonstration.
     *
