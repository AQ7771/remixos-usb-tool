/* QDesignerDialog / QDesignerWidget are used to paint a grid on QDialog and QWidget main containers
 * and container extension pages.
 * The paint routines work as follows:
 * We need to clean the background here (to make the parent grid disappear in case we are a container page
 * and to make palette background settings take effect),
 * which would normally break style sheets with background settings.
 * So, we manually make the style paint after cleaning. On top comes the grid
 * In addition, this code works around
 * the QStyleSheetStyle setting Qt::WA_StyledBackground to false for subclasses of QWidget.
